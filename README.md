### Synopsis

For my Honors Contract project for the Spring 2021 semester, I created an autonomous robot based on a Raspberry Pi. The robot consists of a 3d printed chassis printed on my Ender 3, four dc gearbox motors and wheels, a l298n board to drive the motors, a camera module, ultrasonic distance sensor, and to control everything a Raspberry Pi 4. The robot can be operated in two modes. The first is a remote controlled mode, the second is autonomous mode.
